# COMP4610_Homework_5
The fifth homework for Graphical User Interface Design. Created a scrabble board game using html, css and java script. There are two versions of this. Each are located in there own folder. The one_line allows you to play only on the top line of the board, while the full_board allows you to play on the full board. Both versions have the same features except for the fact the full board allows vertical words, read from top to bottom. 
## Features
* The word that is being played and score is shown in real time.
* Bonus squares accuratly multiply the letter/word score.
* Submit button saves the score, gives the player new tiles, replacing the played ones and clears the board so a new word can be played.
* Reset button brings all pieces played in a round back to the players hand.
* Restart button clears the board, gives the player 7 new pieces and clears the score.
* The first piece can be put anywhere, with all other pieces needing to be put next to a piece.
* Uses the dictionary, copied to words.txt, to determine if the word exsists or not (only works with https).
* Trash can allows for the player to throw away any pieces for new ones without having to play them. 
* (On full board only) Words can be played from left to right or top to bottom.
