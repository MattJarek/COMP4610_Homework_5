The fourth homework for Graphical User Interface Design. 
Created a scrabble board game using html, css and java script.
There are two versions of this, the one line allows you to play only on the top line of the board,
while the full board allows you to play on the full board. Both versions have the same features except for the fact
the full board allows vertical words, read from top to bottom. 
##features
*The first piece can be put anywhere, with all other
pieces needing to be put next to a piece
